Workload is spread over the whole team,2,https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/graphs/contributors?from=2021-11-12&to=2021-12-07&type=c,as seen in this insights – the highest no of commits from the active contributor is 38 while the lowest from an inactive contributor is 10. Not spread uniformly

Use of version control tools,3,Hosted in Git (version control tool) - https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/tree/main ,

Use of code coverage,3,"https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml
https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/blob/main/codecov.yml",Covers 55%; 
Other automated analysis tools,0,No other tools used other than the ones mentioned above,
Test Cases exist,3,https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/tree/main/test ,
Test cases are routinely executed,3,https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml,code cov - 55%; separate tests folder exists
The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up,3,https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md ,"Has a detailed overview of coding stds, how to extend the code , Heroku deployment"
"issues are discussed before they are closed even if you discuss in slack, need a summary statement here",2,https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/issues/6 ,Few of them are discussed and few aren’t
Chat channel: exists,2,Nothing mentioned about it in the repo but assuming there should have been one,
Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.,2,https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/issues/,Not all issues/bugs are from failed testcases; less no of failure testcases in the test suite
Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files,3,https://github.com/mtkumar123/MyDollarBot/compare/main...secheaper:slashbot:main,
"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)",3,https://github.com/mtkumar123/MyDollarBot/compare/main...secheaper:slashbot:main,"From the commit history, we can observe multiple people are updating the repo and adding features. They are working on the saem src and config files"
"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)",3,https://github.com/mtkumar123/MyDollarBot/compare/main...secheaper:slashbot:main,
Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base,3,"https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/network
https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/commits/main","Multiple people are working on different parts/ features of the same project - from commit history, you can see prople editing the same file at different places."
Short release cycles,1,"https://github.com/secheaper/slashbot/tags
